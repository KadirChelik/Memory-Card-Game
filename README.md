# Memory Card Game

This project includes a simple web application that presents the classic memory card game in a digital form. The game aims to test the users' memory and matching skills.

This project is not fully responsive yet, and I will continue to improve the code for better readability.

## Demo

- To try the game, you can visit the [demo on Vercel](https://memory-card-game-tan.vercel.app/).
